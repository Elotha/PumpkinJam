  dialogue:
  - Hey there!
  - How did you find the subway station? Is it to your tastes? Oh nevermind. Not
    like you can answer me anyways.
  - You are probably wondering why you are here.. In the middle of a subway.
  - "I don\u2019t know! That\u2019s on you to think and figure it out."
  - Not everything is supposed to have a meaning. Not every game is going to hold
    your hand and guide you too, you know!
  - Okay, enough chit chat. You are still a baby in here, you just learned how to
    walk! What is your first word in this new life?
