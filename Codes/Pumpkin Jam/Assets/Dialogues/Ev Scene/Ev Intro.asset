  - So... Aren't you going to show me around your house?
  - Just kidding, I already know here like the back of my hand.
  - ...
  - Maybe not! Haha...ha...ha...
  - I can't believe you're in high school! You grew up too fast. It makes my eyes
    teary.
  - 'Though I must admit, school is tough. '
  - I wonder, what kind of student are you?
  - I bet you are popular in class. You only become a teen once in your life, so
    better live those moments full of adventure.
  - Oh wait wait! I know! Maybe you are the quiet-but-very-smart kind of student!
    It's difficult keeping up with lessons so make sure you study hard.
